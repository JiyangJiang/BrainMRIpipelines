# BrainMRIpipelines (BMP) - pipelines for neuroimaging data processing

BrainMRIpipelines contains pipelines neuroimaging data processing. It includes pipelines for converting DICOM to NIFTI data, and processing structural, diffusion, and functional MRI data. Although the scripts are developed to run on computational resources available at Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA), University of New South Wales, they are written with generalisation in mind. Most of them can be applied to different datasets with different computational resources (multi-core workstations, PBS-based HPC, etc.).
