# Once the data have been arranged in the proper directory structure and naming convention,
# they are ready to be preprocessed. Preprocessing includes
#
# 1) Template Creation
# 2) Brain Mask Creation
# 3) Registration with FreeSurfer Anatomical
# 4) Motion Correction
# 5) Slice Timing Correction (if using)
# 6) Spatial Normalization
# 7) Masking
# 8) Spatial Smoothing
#
# In FS-FAST, it is assumed that each data set will be analyzed in three normalization spaces:
#
# 1) Left Cortical Hemisphere
# 2) Right Cortical Hemisphere
# 3) Subcortical Structures (Volume-based)
#
# Output:
#
# - f.nii (the raw data)
# - fmc.nii (motion corrected-MC)
# - fmcsm5.nii (MC & smoothed)
# - fmc.mcdat - text file with the MC parameters (AFNI)
# - mcextreg.bhdr - binary mask of the brain
#
# fmcpr.up.sm5.fsaverage.lh.nii.gz - Left hemisphere of fsaverage
# fmcpr.up.sm5.fsaverage.rh.nii.gz - Right hemisphere of fsaverage
# fmcpr.sm5.mni305.2mm.nii.gz - Volume of fsaverage (MNI305 space) - for subcortical analyses
#
# Time series data - names indicate what has been performed on them:
# 
# fmcpr - motion correction, per-run
# up - slice-timing correction using ascending
# sm5 - smoothed by 5mm FWHM (after resampling)
# fsaverage.lh - sampled on the surface of fsaverage left hemi
# fsaverage.rh - sampled on the surface of fsaverage right hemi
# mni305.2mm - sampled in the fsaverage (MNI305) volume at 2mm isotropic
