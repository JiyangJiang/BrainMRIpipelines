# TO-DO
# -----
# 1) use scripts from internet to generate fsf file.
# 2) FIX may perform better if trainined in MAS/OATS/SCS.
# 3) this script will finally need to be modified to take
#    arguments (object-oriented).
# 4) fieldmap correction.
# 5) FSL group tends to do spatial smoothing and reg to
#    standard space after FIX.
# 6) should WM/CSF mean signal regression be done after
#    FIX?
