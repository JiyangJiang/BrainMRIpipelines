Human Connectome Project - Aging
================================
Note that HCP data processing was conducted on Katana. Therefore, some settings are specific to the platform. All the content can be found on `HCP Pipelines <https://github.com/Washington-University/HCPpipelines/wiki/Installation-and-Usage-Instructions>`_, and `HCP ASL pipeline <https://github.com/physimals/hcp-asl>`_ webpages. This webpage is meant to record what I have done, what problems I encountered, and how I resolved them, for future replication and educating new students.
