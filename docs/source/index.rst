Welcome to BrainMRIpipelines documentation!
===================================

BrainMRIpipelines (BMP) record how I process neuroimaging data at Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA), University of New South Wales. The purposes are to allow future replication of results, and educate new PhD students. Also, the processing steps and some tips and tricks can be generalised to other datasets.
