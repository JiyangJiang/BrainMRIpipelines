According to the Docker Document, the recommended way is to use the platform-independent daemon.json file, which is located in /etc/docker/ on Linux by default.

Set the following flags in the daemon.json file:

{
  "data-root": "/mnt/docker-data",
  "storage-driver": "overlay"
}

After adding an override file, you need to reload systemd's config in order for it to take effect. You may need to run systemctl daemon-reload and then try restarting docker again via systemctl restart docker for the override to be used
