STEP ONE: BAD SKULL STRIP EDITING:

http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/SkullStripFix

o Check the output of skull strip:

$tkmedit <subject name> brainmask.mgz -aux T1.mgz -surfs


o 2 Ways for editing bad skull strip:

1.  Adjusting watershed parameters: 

1)Change the preflooding height:

The mri_watershed program uses a default preflooding height of 25 percent. 
If part of the brain has been removed, make that number larger than 25. 
If part of the skull has been left, make the height less than 25.

$recon-all -skullstrip -wsthresh <h> -clean-bm -s <subjectid>  

<h> is replaced with the preflooding height you'd like to use 
<subjectid> is replaced with your subject.
The clean-bm flag is used to instruct recon-all to write over the old brainmask.mgz volume with your new edits. If you do not use this flag your changes will not take effect. 

Then check the new output (same directive as before):

$tkmedit <subjectid> brainmask.mgz -aux T1.mgz -surfs

2)Using gcut for lefting dura:

recon-all -skullstrip -clean-bm -gcut -subjid <subjid>

3)Use talairach_with_skull_2.lta, with a more accurate atlas

$cd $SUBJECTS_DIR/yoursubj/mri/transforms
$cp talairach_with_skull.lta bak
$cp talairach_with_skull_2.lta talairach_with_skull.lta
$recon-all -s yoursubj -skullstrip -clean-bm -clean-lta

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
2.  Manual editing brainmask.mgz to remove skull/dura
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

a) it is worthwhile to run gcut (and adjust preflooding height (see above)) to automatically remove dura, 
   and then perform manual editing of brainmask

   recon-all -skullstrip -clean-bm -gcut -subjid <subjid>

b) start freeview for editing

	freeview -v sub-100130/mri/T1.mgz sub-100130/mri/brainmask.mgz:colormap=heat

c) edit brainmask with 'recon edit' and 'clone edit'

d) Save volume...then run 

#!/bin/bash
export SUBJECTS_DIR=/home/jiyang/Work/SCS_noDementia_FreeSurfer_editing/no_dementia
for i in `ls -d sub-*`;do
	recon-all -autorecon2 -autorecon3 -subjid ${i} -bigventricles
done

e) NOTES: 
	1. not including -FLAIR/-FLAIRpial as FLAIR pial surface is not accurate empiracally
	2. added -bigventricles because current example is in Sydney Centenarians Study

STEP TWO: EDITING CONTROL POINT
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ref = https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/ControlPointsV6.0

Sometimes the intensity normalization (step 12) will fail because it cannot determine the proper intensity for white matter. The result is an erroneous white matter segmentation. 
So add control point for excluded white matter only. Other kinds of WM errors should be edited in the "white matter editing"

Marginal WM could be too fine to add control points and is NOT recognized as WM if wm parcellation is NOT continuous within slides. This should be corrected by wm editing.

You want to pick points in a region where the wm intensity is lower than it should be (that is, having a voxel value less than 110). General tips for adding control points:

- Control points should only be added in regions that are definitely white matter (i.e., not in the cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, or outside of the skull).
- Control points should be added in wm voxels that have voxel values far from 110. By "far from," we mean wm voxels are between a value of 85 and 100.
- Control points may also be added to voxels that are close to 110. By "close to," we mean wm voxels have an intensity value of somewhere between 100 and 109.
- Control points should also only be added in regions where voxel intensity is not 110. A control point in a region that is already normalized to 110 will be useless.
- Control points should NOT be used to try and normalize a brain lesion to 110. Such defects should be fixed with white matter edits.
- Control points can help recover thin wm strands that are dark by putting some at the base of the strand.
- Control points are also useful in areas of very bright intensity.
- Start off with a few control points spread out in your trouble area. You may need to add more. With experience you will be able to determine how many are appropriate, 
  given your specific subject.
- If you find yourself adding 10s or 100s of control points, you are adding too many. Just a few should do the trick.

a) open freeview to add control points (see Ref for details)

b) After saving contro points, run:

#!/bin/bash
export SUBJECTS_DIR=/home/jiyang/Work/SCS_noDementia_FreeSurfer_editing/no_dementia
for i in `ls -d sub-*`;do
	recon-all -autorecon2-cp -autorecon3 -subjid $i -bigventricles
done

c) NOTES:
	1. added -bigventricles because current example is in Sydney Centenarians Study



STEP THREE: EDITING WHITE MATTER

http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/WhiteMatterEdits

First load: 

$tkmedit <subjectid> brainmask.mgz -aux wm.mgz -surfs

Ctrl+1/+2 to swicth view

Or load surface view: 

$ tksurfer <subjectid> rh inflated / tksurfer <subjectid> lh inflated 

3 issues to be checked: 
1) Geometric inaccuracy due to brain lesion: white matter being excluded from the wm.mgz volume due to white matter lesions;
2) Non-white matter classified as white matter;
3) Lateral Ventricle
4) Marginal errors: incontinuous of marginal WM and/or Dura included as WM or GM

Edit: Edit Voxels Tool button icon, then go to Tools --> Configure Brush Info... 
Set the radius to 2 and Shape to be Circle. 
By default tkmedit will edit on the main volume loaded, if the wm volume is loaded as your aux volume you will also need to select Aux volume as the Target. 
Use the middle button on your mouse to begin painting in the voxels. If you fill in too many voxels, the right mouse button acts as an eraser.

After editing, then run:
$recon-all -autorecon2-wm -autorecon3 (-no-isrunning) -s <subjid>

STEP FOUR: EDITING PIAL SURFACE

http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FsTutorial/PialEdits

Load output: 

$ tkmedit <subjectid> brainmask.mgz -surfs

Tools -> Configure Brush Info... Set Radius to 2, and Shape to "Circle". Click the "Edit Voxels" button in tkmedit toolbar.

Find a place in the image where the dura is causing errors in the segmentation. Use the right mouse button to delete the voxels. 

Repaint the removed volume:

If you remove too many voxels, you can use the clone tool to paint areas back in from the original T1 volume. Load T1 as aux volume. To paint voxels, go to Tools -> Configure Volume Brush... , in the tkmedit toolbar.Set Mode to "Clone", and Clone Source to "Aux Volume". To change the size and shape of your brush, go to: Tools -> Configure Brush Info...

Click the "Edit Voxels" button in tkmedit toolbar and use the middle button on the mouse to paint in voxels from the auxiliary volume

At any time, you can save the changes you've made to the brainmask.mgz volume by selecting 'Save Volume' in tkmedit's 'File' menu, and clicking 'OK' 

Regenerating the Surface:

$ recon-all -autorecon-pial -s <subjid>
