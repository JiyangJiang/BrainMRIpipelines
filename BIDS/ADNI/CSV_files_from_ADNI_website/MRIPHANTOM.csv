The consensus was that the artifact was most likely due to the phantom still being in flux from movement.  Most likely the phantom was hauled between scanners and scanned prior to the fluid getting settled. Dr. Jack, Bernstein, and Felmlee agreed that the images are still ok to use for ADNI.  We would recommend the site let the phantom sit for about 15 mins before scanning is possible.","2008-04-16 00:00:00.0"
