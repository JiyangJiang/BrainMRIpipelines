In the current analysis (version 2.1), we implemented a slightly different version called ROBEXdeterministic. ROBEXdeterministic is a version of ROBEX that produces exactly the same output when run twice on the same scan. Because ROBEX has a probabilistic component, this was not necessarily the case with the original ROBEX. The only difference between the two programs is that ROBEXdeterministic initializes the random number generator with the value of the central voxel in the input scan, making its output exactly reproducible. Because the core algorithm is exactly the same in both versions, the performance of ROBEX and ROBEXdeterministic is(on average) identical. For more information about Robex and ROBEXdeterministic, please visit https://www.nitrc.org/frs/shownotes.php?release_id=2424.
