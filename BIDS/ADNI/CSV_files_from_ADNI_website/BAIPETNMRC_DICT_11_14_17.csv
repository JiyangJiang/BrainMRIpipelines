(3) (internal note) analysis on linux? /analysis/ADNI/quals/analysis/long_082007/ANOVA_bslm06_NPS. (4) SPM analyses were performed by ADNI Analysis Team Members: Kewei Chen, Ph.D., Eric M.

(5), data subject to change due to addition/change of subjects, time points and/or analysis type. (6), some brain regions, reported in AD neuroimaging literature, are included in the table w/o numeric data.(7), the field name consists of two parts: part 1 (the character string, maximum of 8 characters) is the brain region, and part 2 (the two digits at the very end) are index indicating analysis types. Variable suffix 04 corresponds to AD CMRgl decline compared to that of normal controls over a 6 month period.","-4","","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","2017-11-20 09:04:49.0"

This fROI is then directly applied to the testing dataset for final power estimate.  for each subject, beta values were extracted and averaged over the  defined functional ROI ( fROI, reflecting consistent CMRgl declines) for AD and  MCI separately. For  NL, the fROI for AD was ued for data extraction (data extracted using fROI for MCI was also performed but not included in this round of uploading). These data were extracted from ALL subjects.

(2) The reference region used for each individual subject is the so-called spared region. (3) sROI measures the  CMRgl decline for an individual subject. It is a global index, thus is free of multiple comparison issue. (4) This set of the sROI scores were calculated based on SPM8.  (5).  These data should be considered preliminary, since we continue to refine our sROI approach, and other changes in the future (more data from ADNI2 and beyond, e.g).
