He is diabetic (non-insulin dependent) and drinks alcohol but has no history of alcohol dependency or abuse.  His last blood studies from his personal physician (who has cared fro him since 1988) were normal (a GTT was not obtained).  There is no indication in his medical file that he has active liver disease or had a history of liver disease in the past.  Given the normal values for Alk Phos, ALT and AST, I do not feel there is any clinical reason for further evaluation and feel he remains qualified to participate in ADNI and would qualify to participate in an AD treatment trial as long as the experimental drug had no direct liver toxicity.

She says his memory does not interfere with his daily functioning, he rarely forgets major events, details, and info regarding the distant past. Second, the subject may perceive to have a consistent memory problem, but he correctly answered all questions on page 7, except for some things about memory within the past month.

In 07/07, he had a CT scan of the spine, which demonstrated abnormal signal within the L4 and L5 vertebral bodies and edema in the adjacent disk. Most of the pathology was in the anterior portion of the lumbar spine, rather than the posterior portion. The patient had a biopsy in hospital on 7/19/07, and the culture was positive for Actinomyces.

After speaking with PI (Dr. Ott), he suggested the back pain appeared to be related to the LP and Dr. Ott suggested the patient take some tylenol PRN and if symptom worstened or became more severe to call 911 for emergency medical help or the clinic for non-emergency follow up.

Betty did have another bladder infection (chronic bladder infections present on medical history).  The infection started on 5-14-2012 and her physician told her to start taking her remaining cefuroxime which was not effective and discontinued on 5-20-2012.  She was then prescribed Cipro which she took from 5-21-2012 through 5-26-2012, bladder infection was successfully treated.

The patient has a progressive change in memory and cognitive function that includes word-finding difficulty without focal neurologic or parkinsonian findings or significant personality or behavioral manifestations.

She has no recollection, she is having difficulty using computer and needs help which is worrisome given her history as computer programmer. She also needs assist @ times with her iPhone as it is getting harder to use. She makes mistakes within finances and he has to help/assist now. She can no longer handle complicated finances. She burned a skillet on the stove recently and has become nervous of cooking. Husband reads a lot about dementia and feels she easily fits into stage IV dementia. He has concern of LBD which is also concerning to me given ? of REM sleep changes (vs. hypnopompic AH) and she is having gait changes and falls-? early Parkinsonism? No overt Parkinsonism on exam today but slight increased tone w/activation. She may have mixed pathology of AD + LBD-will continue to monitor for evidence of Parkinsonism/AD. Interestingly, her testing is not much changed overall-her SOB is now 3.5 but CDR stable 0.5.

The participant did not complete the PET AV 45 at this visit as scheduled.  Our site received an email the morning of the PET scan to inform us of a malfunction of the dose for the AV1451 dose in production.  Our PET technician confused a scheduled PET AV 45 participant with another scheduled Tau participant and ordered the wrong dose for the wrong visit. With this in mind, the dose that we would have received that morning failed in production of AV1451 that morning, due to issues with the equipment. The participant will rescheduled for his PET AV scan.","2016-07-22 19:44:39.0"
