In ADNI all fMRI the slices are axial and here they are always counted from inferior to superior.   This is invariant to the way the data is stored in DICOM.  For Philips scanners the DICOM data do not indicate the slice acquisition order and it is inferred from knowledge of the protocols in use on the scan acquisition date if necessary.    Slice ordering should be determined from the Siemens CSA header.   GE slice ordering should be determined by the time for each slice in the DICOM header.  The notion of when time equals zero is determined by the vendor data if possible.","2020-05-05 13:59:21.0"
