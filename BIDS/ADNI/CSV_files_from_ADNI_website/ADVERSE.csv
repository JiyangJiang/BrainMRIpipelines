During the ER visit (02/17/22), the patient was poor historian and could not give further details on the number of falls or the events that proceeded the events. When asked about the falls she states she has fallen around 2-3 times at home. Her husband was the person who called EMS because he did not feel he could care for her anymore, and he felt she needed a higher level of care.  Her primary complaint during the ER visit was general abdominal pain, which the care team determined was r/t worsening metastatic colon cancer (see AE #3). Given her presentation at the ED on 02/17/22, the ED providers began palliative care discussions with the family and the participant was place on hospice. Her health quickly declined and she died on 03/14/22 from worsening metastatic cancer (see AE #3). No further details were provided via EMR notes on frequency or onset of her falls at home. Of note, there were minor bruises over her lower legs and upper arms that were non-tender noted on her ER assessment on 02/17/22. No additional documentation of falls was noted in her EMR.

I had a long discussion with patient's wife, son and daughter-in-law. Explained them that planned bronchoscopy today will carry higher risk than average for worsening respiratory failure which may result in patient's intubation and
placement on mechanical ventilation. They all expressed that patient wishes as well as theirs, would be not to go on the breathing machine, i.e. no intubation or mechanical ventilation however, they would like to continue rest of medical management including antibiotics, and rest of medical management -I explained to them that additional antimicrobial will be a form of empiric therapy as it is difficult to determine exact pathogen to target given the inability to perform bronchoscopy and BAL, they
expressed full understanding to our discussion -Geriatric team as well as palliative care team will continue to follow-up with the patient -We have discussed with infectious disease team to continue current antimicrobial consider adding Bactrim for empiric treatment of PCP, given inability to perform diagnostic bronchoscopy with BAL due to risk of intubation given worsening respiratory status for the patient. -CLL status post chemotherapy
