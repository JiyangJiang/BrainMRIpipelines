(3) In the subsequent group analysis, factors such as age, gender, apoe4 were not considered.    (4) Subjects were NOT divided into training/testing groups. The analysis was  for  subjects whose data were available at the time of the initiation and whose data passed the internal QA . (5) Whole brain atrophy detected by IPCA is a global index, thus is free of multiple comparison issue. (6) The numerical value for each subject is the atrophy rate from baseline to 12 month (though it was listed for the baseline row in the numerical sheet, it is a single measure for both baseline and 12 month). The IPCA measured whole brain atrophy we observed from analyzing multiple datasets is below 5% (hence the theoretical [-5 5] range, which is true for this dataset","-4","","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","-4","2016-09-13 09:18:12.0"
