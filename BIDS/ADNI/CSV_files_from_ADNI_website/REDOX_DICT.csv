Preparation of Serum Samples  (1) Aliquots of ADNI serum samples stored at -80oC are thawed. CleanasciteTM (Biotech Support Group Inc. North Brunswick, NJ) is suspended by gently rocking prior to use. (2) 1:4 vol/vol of CleanasciteTM is added to each serum sample in a 2 ml micro tube, using a pipette tip with an orifice cut to ~0.5 mm. The dilution factor of the serum is ~1.125 (3) The samples are rocked at 37oC by placing the tubes on their side on the platform of a Lab Line Titer-Plate Microplate Shaker in an incubator for 10 min and centrifuged for 1 min. at 16,000 _ g. (4) The supernatants are carefully removed, and the samples are divided into two for ± treatment with hemin (see below). (B) Preparation of serum dilution buffer ± hemin. (1) Hemin powder (Frontier Scientific, Logan UT) is taken from storage at 4oC (Cat. # H651-9 Batch FS108-50). A ~112 mM stock solution of hemin (MW = 651.96) is prepared by dissolving hemin powder in 1 M NaOH with warming and vigorous stirring. (2) The solution is left to cool to room temperature for 2 hr and filtered through a 0.45 micron filter. The concentration of hemin is then accurately determined by using the mean mM extinction coefficient of hemin in NaOH of a sample appropriately diluted in 5 mM NaOH; 5.84 cm_1 M_1 at 385 nm (Li et al. Acta Biochimica et Biophysica Sinica, 2006; 38:63Ð69). (3) The stock hemin solution is stable for at least 4 months at 4oC.  (4) Tris buffered saline buffer (pH 7.3 ± 0.03) (TBS) is prepared as a 10x stock and diluted prior to use to 20 mM Tris base,151 mM NaCl, 3mM NaN3. (5) The stock hemin solution in NaOH is slowly added to the TBS buffer to a final concentration of 1.35 mM. Note volume of NaOH added. Adjust the pH of the hemin TBS buffer to 7.8 ± 0.03 with 1M HCl.  (6) In a separate 100 ml beaker, add the same volume of TBS buffer, and add an equivalent volume of 1M NaOH that was used for the hemin solution. Adjust the pH to 7.8 ± 0.03 with 1M HCl.  (7) The two aliquots of serum samples from each donor are diluted to a final of 1:15 vol/vol in either the hemin or TBS buffer ph 7.8. Note: The 1:15 dilution should take into account the 1.125 fold dilution of the serum samples following CleanasciteTM treatment. The samples are placed on an orbital shaker in an incubator at 37oC for 3hr then frozen at -80oC for ELISA analysis. (9) The samples are thawed, and diluted in either bovine serum albumin (BSA) or adult bovine plasma (ABP), diluted in TBS pH 7.3 at a final serum dilution of 1:50 for ELISA analyses. The BSA and ABP must be diluted in TBS such that the final concentrations of BSA and ABP in the ELISA are 1% and 10%, respectively. Procedure #2: (1) Aliquots of ADNI serum samples stored at -80oC are thawed and 100ul added to 900 ul of both  the hemin and NaOH control solution prepared as detailed above in B1-B6. (2)  The samples are incubated for 20 hr on a rocking platform at 36oC, then frozen at -80oC for  ELISA analysis.   (3)  The samples are thawed and diluted in either bovine serum albumin (BSA) or adult bovine plasma (ABP), diluted in TBS, pH 7.3 at a final serum dilution of 1:100 for ELISA analyses. The BSA and ABP must be diluted in TBS to reach a final concentration 1% and 10%, respectively. (4)  The aPL ELISA method (McIntyre, et al. Immunobiology 2003; 207:59-63) is altered such that the IgG plates are stopped at 25 min and the IgA and IgM plates are stopped at 30 min.
