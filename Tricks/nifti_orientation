# ISSUE
# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# AP/SI orientation labels are mislabelled, i.e. AP is shown in the orientation
# supposed to be top-bottom

# In FSL, it is recommended to
#
# 	fslorient -deleteorient imagename
# 	fslswapdim imagename a b c imagename
# 	fslorient -setqformcode 1 imagename 
#
# where a b c can be x -x y -y z -z.
#
# However, this cannot fix the wrong order of y and z, as the labels associated 
# with the y-axis and z-axis follow the image change

# UPDATE 06/12/2020
# This turns out to be version dependent. In FSL versions before 6, 'fslorient -deleteorient'
# is able to delete/reset all qform/sform info, whereas in FSL version 6 and onwards only
# the qform_code and sform_code are set to 0, and 'fslswapdim' command cause the flipping of
# both qform_x/y/zorient and the actural image - therefore, this is not effective in the case
# of mislabelled orientation. The philosophy is to prevent accidental changes of orientation
# which is supposed to be low-level info that are not supposed to be changed manually. The
# label should be collated in the raw data (e.g. DICOM, hdr/img, par/rec, etc).

# Jmod way
#
# 1) Use 3drefit from AFNI:
#
# 		3dcopy in.nii test
# 		3drefit -orient RIP test+orig
# 		3dcopy test+orig out.nii
#
#    The 3 letters (RIP in this case) need to be determined by visualising in.nii,
#    i.e. what is the actual direction when adding in x-, y-, and z-axis.
#
#	 NOTE : This method will cause AC being distant from origin of image. This will cause
#           SPM error of segmentation failure (matrix is singular ...) 
#           (Ref : https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=SPM;81b38bce.1611).
#           This can be resolved by running acpcdetect. keep in mind that acpcdetect
#           will only allow data type of short or unsigned short as input. this can be
#           achieved by runing 'fslmaths -odt short'. In addition, running fslreorient2std
#			prior to acpcdetect will help reduce search range. Alternatively, try reg to standard
#           brain as suggested in the above link.
#
# 2) Use FSL versions before 6
#
# 		fslorient -deleteorient imagename
# 		fslswapdim imagename a b c imagename
# 		fslorient -setqformcode 1 imagename
#
#    Note that the 4-by-4 qform/sform matrices will be overwritten, whereas in the
#    first method with AFNI the original matrices are preserved.
